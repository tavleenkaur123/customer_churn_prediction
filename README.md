**CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**
Customer churn is a critical concern for telecom companies, as losing customers directly impacts revenue and growth. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn using historical telecom customer data. By identifying high-risk customers, businesses can take proactive steps to improve retention and optimize marketing strategies.
